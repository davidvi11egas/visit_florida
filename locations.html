										spaceflight simulators and – if your timing is just right – even view a launch.

										Key West, the southernmost point in the United States, is famous for
										watersports, lively nightlife, beaches, historic sites and its pastel,
										conch-style architechture.
										Duval Street, one of the most energetic strips of shops, bars and cafes
										anywhere, offers Sloppy Joe’s bar, a favorite Key West hangout of novelist
										Ernest Hemingway.
									</p>
									<p>
										And, for the more sober-minded, there's Ernest Hemingway Home and Museum. (Look
										for the celebrated six-toed cats).
										Walking tours of Key West are the best way to see the island's intriguing homes,
										courtyards and gardens. Start in the center of town at the Key West City
										Cemetery, which offers a glimpse of Key West's past and its offbeat sense of
										humor, as exhibited by gravestones that read, "I told you I was sick," and "At
										least I know where he's sleeping tonight."

										Clearwater Beach dazzles with impeccable beaches and inviting waters. Trip
										Advisor named it the nation's #1 beach in 2018. Caladesi Island, off the north
