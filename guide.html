							Peak season is November to April, with the biggest influx during “snowbird season” in January and February. However, with theme park attractions, summer is also a high season to travel to Florida. Many southerners flock to the coastal areas of the Panhandle and the Keys during spring break and then in the summer to escape the humidity. Ideal times to vacation or travel in Florida are September and October and April and May. Weather is more comfortable, and tourist traffic is at a minimum.
